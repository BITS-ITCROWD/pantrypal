25/6 Started trying to connect to database for recipes page
26/6 With the help of Luke's code the database is now connecting, search 
     function is also working for recipe name.  
27/6-28/6 Working on presenting results as pages.  Page numbers are OK but 
     data not displaying
     Added footer.php and sidebar.php to page.
29/6 Moved testing for pages to mark_testing.php
     Looking into main content panels and headers/sidebars from bootstrap

         <p><b>PantryPal</b> is a cute invention by struggling Open uni students to demonstrate their ability to collaborate and learn together.</p> 
         
         <h4>They called themselves the IT Crowd.</h4>
         
         <p>When they're not programming a website, they're changing nappies, making dinner for the family, working, discussing rugby, dropping the kids off at school, or having a drink.</p>
         
         <p><b>PantryPal</b> was built specifically for the Building IT Systems (lovingly referred to as "bits") RMIT subject; we think it has potential to become more than an assignment, and maybe one day it will!</p>
